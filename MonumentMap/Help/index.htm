        <p>
            Monument map is a program you can use to keep track of monuments around the world. You can add them, update them,
            place them on the map, update their locations on the map, define types of monuments and attach tags to monuments that
            you've created. You could also use it to keep track of all the places you visited. The sky is the limit.
